      Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and
      Sergey Brin while they were both PhD students at Stanford University in
      California, United States. The project initially involved an
      unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who
      wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left
      before Google was officially founded as a company Hassan went on
      to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in
      2006.
